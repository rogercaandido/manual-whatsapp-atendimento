**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- **ISSUE**: 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain in FR-011, FR-012, FR-013
- All requirements except the clarification markers are testable
- Success criteria include specific metrics (percentages, times, scores)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation
- 5 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases section covers multiple scenarios
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
- Assumptions section documents 10 key assumptions

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- **ISSUE**: FR-011, FR-012, FR-013 need clarification before acceptance criteria can be fully defined
- User scenarios cover: discovery, exploration, conversion, trust-building, and multi-device access
- 10 success criteria with specific, measurable targets
- Spec maintains focus on user needs without technical details
